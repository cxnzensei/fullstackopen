This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To run the application,

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run server`

Hosts the Local file 'db.json' as a development server which can be used to store, update, delete, retrieve etc. via axios.

You'll have to keep two terminals open in your text-editor as well as 2 tabs:

localhost3000 => React App

localhost3001 => for development server

If something else is running on these ports then clear that and then run this app.
